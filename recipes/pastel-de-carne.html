        <h1>Pastel de Carne</h1>
        <p>One of the most beloved brazilian recipes, it's similar to argentinian empanadas and it consists in a fried pastry filled with ground meat, boiled eggs and some spices. But feel free to stuff it with anything you like of course.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>200 g of ground beef</li>
                <li>1 tomato</li> 
                <li>1/2 onion</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove</li>
                <li>chives</li>
                <li>3 springs of parsley</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Steps to make the filling</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash, dry and cut the tomato in half, discard the seeds and cut each half into small cubes. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Wash, dry and finely chop the chives and parsley</li>
                <li>Place a medium saucepan over medium heat. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, add the meat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let it brown for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally with a spatula to break up the pieces – this way the meat remains very loose, ideal for filling the pastries (pastel).</li>
                <li>Transfer the browned meat to a bowl and keep the pan over medium heat. Drizzle with another 1 tablespoon of olive oil, add the onion and sauté for 2 minutes until wilted. Add the garlic, cumin, paprika and stir for 1 minute to perfume. Add the tomato and stir well for 2 minutes until it starts to soften.
                </li>
                <li>Return the meat to the pan and mix well. Add the parsley and chives, taste and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely at room temperature before assembling the pastries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Assembling the pastries and frying</h2>
            <p>You're gonna need a round shaped pastry like <a href="https://shoppr.com.br/cdn/shop/products/2974545f40cf4b3b4a907f9aeec3d932_grande.png?v=1439614098">this one</a> to make the pastel (or pastries). You can try to find it at some grocery store (brazilian or anywhere that sells latin american products) or you can make it on your own, I believe it's the same recipe for lasagna or pasta.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To assemble the pastries: simply place the meat filling on the pastry dough along with the chopped boiled eggs, fold the dough and use a fork to seal.</li>
                <li>In a pan, heat the oil and when it is hot, carefully place the pastries in the pan and fry until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Let the pastries cool over a oil draining rack</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Enjoy!!!</p>
