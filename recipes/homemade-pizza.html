    <h1>Homemade Pizza</h1>
    <p>The only recipe that works for me, not exactly like the original italian one but it does the job!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>I strongly recomend using a kitchen scale for this recipe (and other bread recipes!)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg of bread flour (with protein content of at least 10%)</li>
        <li>600g of cold water</li>
        <li>5g of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>30g of salt</li>
        <li>30g of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
