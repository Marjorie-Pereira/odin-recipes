    <h1>Homemade Pizza</h1>
    <p>The only recipe that works for me, not exactly like the original italian one but it does the job!</p>
    <img src="../imgs/pizza.jpg" alt="pizza photo">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>I strongly recomend using a kitchen scale for this recipe (and other bread recipes!)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1000g (1kg) of bread flour (with protein content of at least 10%)</li>
        <li>600g of water room temperature</li>
        <li>5g of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>30g of salt</li>
        <li>30g of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a large bowl, pour in 600ml of water and add 30g salt.</li>
        <li>Mix this well using your hand to help dissolve the salt.</li>
        <li>Add 100g (10% flour) to the water and mix it through with your hands until the flour dissolves. This will result in a crepe/pancake consistency.</li>
        <li>Next, add the yeast to the mix helping it to quickly dissolve in the water using your fingers an mix through with your hand again.</li>
        <li>Now, the important part, add the flour using one hand, a small amount at a time, not all at once and mix with your other hand as you go.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has started to come together really well, flip it out on to a bench and start to knead it with both hands absorbing all the remaining flour.</li>
        <li>Keep working the dough until you find it has come together and has a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Next you need to check if your dough has been worked enough: press down on the dough ball with one finger and if it bounces back it’s ready</li>
        <li>Once ready, place the Neapolitan pizza dough aside to rest on a flat surface, covering it with a damp cloth so it doesn’t dry out. Leave this to rest for at least 2hr.</li>
        <li>Once 2hr have passed, it’s time to make your dough balls. To do this, cut a piece of your dough and weigh it on a scale aiming for 250g/8.8oz.</li>
        <li>Once you have made the Neapolitan pizza dough balls, place them in a flat surface air tight container. Leave this in an ambient location with a temperature between 16°C – 18°C / 60.8°F – 64.4°F for 24hr.</li>
        <li>After 24hr your dough balls should have risen and are ready to use. Sprinkle flour on to the bench, placing the dough on top and starting an inch from the bottom and working your way an inch from the top, press down using your fingers. Then stop, turn it over and repeat until you have a small round base with a “cornicione” (crust).</li>
        <li>Gently stretch this by then picking up the dough and slightly stretching it onto one forearm then flipping it onto the bench. Repeat this before shaping it into a circle and then resting it on your bench.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Finishing the pizza</h2>
    <p>This recipe is gonna focus on traditional Margherita Pizza</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by spreading Italian tomato sauce on to your base using the back of a spoon in a circular motion.</li>
        <li>Add fresh basil leaves, a sprinkle of dry oregano, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and thinly sliced cherry tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in a woodfire oven at 400°C/757°F to cook (or using the MAX temp on your oven at home and a pizza stone)</li>
        <li>To turn the pizza and cook it even on both sides, pull it out, turn it then push it back in.</li>
        <li>Once it is ready, break up a large buffalo mozzarella using your hands and serve this fresh on the Neapolitan pizza.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy one of the best things you're gonna taste in life ;)</p>
